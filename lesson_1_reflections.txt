Comparing files with 'diff -u' command is helpful since:
a. It is easier to view what was changed from the last version
b. can spot errors easier, if any


Difference between manual commit in Git and Dropbox?
-Manual commit is flexible.
-Auto saving in Dropbox is not very useful since one cannot maintain useful records of the changes made during the auto save

Git allows multiple files to be saved in one commit, collection of files that are related is called Repository.
Dropbox saves each file separately, files cannot be saved in one shot.
