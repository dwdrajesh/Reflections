When a repository is created, I think a .git folder is created inside the current directory
and the related files for tracking are added to .git.

The files in the current directory are all recorded as "untracked files" since git commit is not done yet.


Staging area:
It allows only particular files to be included in a commit.
For example, only files A and B can be included in a commit while file C in the same directory will 
not be included. 
The status can be checked by : git status 


To add files to the staging area: git add file.txt

To remove files currently in the commit, command:
git rm --cached file.txt

How to add missing file to last commit:
git add file.txt
git commit --amend --no-edit
(no-edit : it will keep the same commit message)

Branching: To keep the main code in the master branch and to add experimental features that may introduce bugs.
